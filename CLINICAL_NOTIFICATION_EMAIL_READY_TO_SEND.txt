WHAT YOU'RE REVIEWING:

□ Workflow Integration
  Does this match your clinical practice? Should we exclude any data types?

□ Data Safety
  Is automatic medical record updating appropriate? Any concerns?

□ Provider Experience
  Will this reduce documentation burden? Improve patient care?

□ Clinical Appropriateness
  Are the deduplication rules sound? Any patient populations where this shouldn't be used?

NEXT STEPS:

After your review, you have three options:

✅ APPROVED
   "System is clinically appropriate and ready for production."

⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
   "Approve pending: [Your specific requirements]"

❌ NOT APPROVED
   "System requires modifications: [Your concerns]"

QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU START?

This is a significant clinical system update. We're available for:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

The Patient Medical History System automatically builds and maintains cumulative patient
medical records from clinical visits. It:

FOR PATIENTS:
• Eliminates need to repeat medical history at every visit
• Ensures faster care through instant access to allergies and contraindications
• Creates complete health record accessible to them

FOR PROVIDERS:
• Provides complete patient context before each appointment
• Reduces documentation overhead through AI-assisted clinical notes
• Automatically updates patient records after each visit
• Shows deduplication (same allergy documented twice = recorded once)

CLINICAL SAFETY:
• HIPAA-compliant encryption (at rest and in transit)
• Role-based access control (providers see only their patients)
• Complete audit trail of all data access
• Intelligent deduplication prevents dangerous duplicate entries
• < 10 minute rollback if any issues occur

TESTING VERIFICATION:
✅ Phase 1: New patient with no history created
✅ Phase 2: First visit data captured (2 allergies, 2 medications, 2 diagnoses)
✅ Phase 3: Cumulative record auto-populated after first visit
✅ Phase 4: Second visit showed complete history from first visit
✅ Phase 5: Deduplication worked perfectly (Penicillin counted once, not twice)
✅ Phase 6: Status updates tracked (Hypertension: active → stable)
